# Dockerfile – Fundamentals

* A **Dockerfile** is a **text file with instructions** to build a Docker image
* It defines **how the image is created**, step by step
* Each instruction creates a **new image layer**
* Ensures **repeatable and consistent image builds**

## What Dockerfile Contains

* Base image (`FROM`)
* Commands to install software (`RUN`)
* Files to copy (`COPY` / `ADD`)
* Default startup command (`CMD` / `ENTRYPOINT`)
* Metadata (ports, environment variables)
