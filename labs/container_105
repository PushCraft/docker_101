## 🧪 Creating a Custom Docker Image Using `docker commit`

This method lets you **turn a modified container into a reusable Docker image**. Think of it as taking a snapshot of a container after you’ve manually installed software or made changes.

⚠️ Important upfront note (very DevOps-relevant):
`docker commit` is **great for learning, debugging, and quick experiments**, but **Dockerfiles are preferred** for production and CI/CD. We’ll still master this because you *will* see it in real environments.


## 🔁 High-Level Workflow (Mental Model)
Pull Image → Run Container → Make Changes → Exit Container → Commit → New Image
*You start with a base image, modify a running container, then freeze those changes into a new image.

---

## 📥 1. Pull a Base Image
### Example
$ docker pull ubuntu:22.04

This image becomes your **foundation layer**.

## ▶️ 2. Run a Container from the Base Image
$ docker container run -it ubuntu:22.04 /bin/
* `-i` → Interactive
* `-t` → Allocate terminal
* `/bin/` → Start a shell inside the container

You are now **inside the container**.
---
## 🛠️ 3. Make Changes Inside the Container
Install packages, create files, update configs, Whatever changes are required etc.

### Example
apt update
apt install -y curl vim nginx
Create a test file:
add custom /etc/skel
echo "Custom Image Created" > /opt/custom.txt

At this point, the container has **state changes** that do *not* exist in the original image.

---
## 🚪 4. Exit the Container
$ exit


The container stops and enters an **Exited** state.
Check:
$ docker container ls -a


You’ll see:
STATUS: Exited (0)



## 📸 5. Commit the Container into a New Image

$ docker commit -m "Commit message" -a "Author Name" <container_id> repoUsername/newImageName:tag

### Example
docker commit \
  -m "Added nginx, curl, vim" \
  -a "Karan DevOps" \
  a1b2c3d4 \
  pushcraft/custom-ubuntu:1.0


### Options Explained
* `-m` → Commit message (what changed)
* `-a` → Author
* `<container_id>` → Exited container ID
* `repo/name:tag` → New image name

## 🖼️ 6. Verify the New Image

$ docker images

Sample output:
REPOSITORY               TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED
pushcraft/custom-ubuntu  1.0     e3f1a9b2c7     10 seconds ago


🎉 Your custom image now exists locally.

---

## ▶️ 7. Run a Container from the New Image
$ docker container run -it pushcraft/custom-ubuntu:1.0 /bin/


Verify your changes:
$ nginx -v
cat /opt/custom.txt

✔️ All installed software and files are present.

## 🧠 What `docker commit` Actually Does
* Captures the **filesystem changes** of a container
* Creates a **new image layer**
* Does **not** capture:
  * Running processes
  * Environment variables set at runtime (unless baked into files)

Think of it like saving a **VM snapshot**, but lighter and layered.

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices & Real-World Notes

### When `docker commit` is useful

* Learning Docker fundamentals
* Debugging production issues
* Creating a quick test image
* Reverse-engineering a container

### When NOT to use it

* CI/CD pipelines
* Team collaboration
* Production image builds

📌 **Why Dockerfiles win**

* Version-controlled
* Repeatable
* Auditable
* Works with CI tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

---

## 🧾 Quick Comparison

| Method        | Use Case                  | Recommended |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| docker commit | Learning / quick snapshot | ⚠️ Limited  |
| Dockerfile    | Production / CI/CD        | ✅ Yes       |

---

## 🧠 Summary (One-Liner)

`docker commit` lets you **turn a modified container into a reusable image**, but Dockerfiles are the **professional standard** for building images in real DevOps workflows.

## 🏷️ Tagging and Pushing Custom Docker Images to Docker Hub

This section covers how to **tag Docker images correctly** and **push them to Docker Hub** so they can be shared, versioned, and deployed across environments.

## 🧠 Understanding Docker Image Tags (Why They Matter)

**Tags are:**
* Version control
* Safety rails
* Communication
All wrapped into a single label.

A **tag** points to a **specific version of an image**.

repository : tag
### Examples:
$ docker pull ubuntu:20.04
$ docker pull ubuntu:22.04

Both images exist side-by-side on your system.

### Default Behavior
If no tag is specified, Docker **silently uses**:
:latest


⚠️ `latest` does **not** mean stable or recommended. It simply means “the default tag.”


## 🏷️ Assigning a Custom Tag to an Image
Tagging lets you rename or version an existing image so it can be pushed to a registry.

### Syntax
$ docker image tag <source_image> <repoUsername>/<newImageName>:<customTag>


### Example
$ docker image tag custom-ubuntu:1.0 pushcraft/custom-ubuntu:v1


### Verify the Tag
$ docker image ls


You will see **multiple tags pointing to the same IMAGE ID**.

---
## 🧠 Important Note:
✅ **Tagging does NOT create a new image**
* Docker tags are **references (aliases)** to the same image ID
* A single image can have **multiple tags**

Example:
text
IMAGE ID        REPOSITORY               TAG
e3f1a9b2c7      custom-ubuntu            1.0
e3f1a9b2c7      pushcraft/custom-ubuntu  v1


Same image. Two names.

---

## 🚀 Pushing a Custom Image to Docker Hub

Once an image is tagged with your Docker Hub username, it can be pushed.

---

### 🔐 1. Log in to Docker Hub

$ docker login
You can authenticate using:
* Username + password
* Personal Access Token
* Web-based login flow

---

### 🔍 2. Confirm Image Name and Tag


$ docker images

Ensure the image name matches:
repoUsername/imageName:tag


Docker Hub **requires** this format.

---

### 📤 3. Push the Image
$ docker image push repoUsername/imageName:customTag


### Example


$ docker image push pushcraft/custom-ubuntu:v1

Docker uploads each image layer to Docker Hub.

example :
 $  docker image push kara101/kara101:tagX kara101/kara101:tagX
---

### ✅ 4. Verify on Docker Hub

* Log in to [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
* Navigate to **Repositories**
* Confirm:
  * Image name
  * Tag
  * Push timestamp

---

## 🧠 Real-World Workflow (End-to-End)

text
docker commit → docker tag → docker push → docker pull → docker run


Used in:

* Team collaboration
* CI/CD pipelines
* Multi-environment deployments
* Kubernetes clusters

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices (Production Mindset)

✔ Use **explicit version tags**
✔ Avoid `latest` in production
✔ Use semantic versioning:

text
1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.1.0 → 2.0.0


✔ Keep tags meaningful:
text
myapp:1.2-alpine
myapp:1.2-slim


---

## 🧾 Summary

* Tags are **labels**, not copies
* One image can have **many tags**
* Docker Hub requires:
  username/image:tag
  
* Tagging enables **versioning, rollback, and sharing**
* Pushing makes images **portable across systems**
