# Docker Image Structure & Layers – Fundamentals

* A **Docker image** is a **read-only template** used to create containers
* Image = **multiple read-only filesystem layers + metadata**
* Image does **not include a kernel** (uses host kernel)

---

## Image Layers

* Each Dockerfile instruction creates a **new layer**
* Layers are **immutable**
* Layers are **cached and shared** across images

---

## Union Filesystem

* Docker stacks layers using **OverlayFS**
* Upper layers override lower layers
* Appears as a single filesystem

---

## Container Layer

* Running a container adds **one writable layer**
* All runtime changes go here
* Deleting container removes changes

---

## Why Layers Matter

* Faster builds (caching)
* Smaller images (layer sharing)
* Reproducible deployments

---

## Best Practice

* Combine commands in one `RUN`
* Always:

```
apt-get update && apt-get install
```

* Clean cache to reduce size

---

## Key Takeaway

**Image = read-only layers**
**Container = image + writable layer**
