What is Docker?
Is a Platform for devs and Sysadmins used to develop, deploy and run containerized apps.

Container?
Is a running process that encapsulates everything an app needs to run ( and only those things )

Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worry about setup or dependencies.

Image?
Is a standaline, isolcated, lightweight and executable package that contains all the required components ( coded, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings ... etc) necessary to run an app.

The container si the runtime instance of the image. From the same image you can launch more containers.

Imageas for many applications can be found on https://hub.docker.com
